## TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### **Stored Procedure Architecture**

#### 1. **UpdateUserLevel(user_id)**
```sql
-- Calculates user level based on green points
-- Updates experience points automatically
-- Maintains level progression consistency
```

#### 2. **ProcessWasteClassification(user_id, category, confidence, actual)**
```sql
-- Processes AI classification results
-- Awards points based on confidence score
-- Logs classification activities
```

#### 3. **CalculatePointsAndRewards(user_id, activity_type, carbon_impact)**
```sql
-- Distributes points for various activities
-- Tracks carbon savings impact
-- Logs reward activities
```

#### 4. **CheckAchievements(user_id)**
```sql
-- Evaluates achievement eligibility
-- Unlocks new achievements automatically
-- Returns achievement count
```

#### 5. **UpdateUserStreaks(user_id)**
```sql
-- Manages daily login streaks
-- Updates longest streak records
-- Awards streak bonus points
```

#### 6. **GenerateDailyAnalytics()**
```sql
-- Compiles daily platform statistics
-- Stores analytics in summary table
-- Provides executive dashboard metrics
```
